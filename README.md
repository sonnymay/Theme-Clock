This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Customizable themes
- Display time in 12-hour format with AM and PM indicators

## Usage

To use the Theme Clock, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The clock will automatically start displaying the current time with the default theme.

To change the theme, click on the dropdown list in the top right corner of the screen and select a theme from the options available.

## Customization
